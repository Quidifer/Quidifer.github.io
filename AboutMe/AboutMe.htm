			<p> <b>Introduction: </b>I am currently a computer science student at UC Riverside. I am also a member of
				<a href="https://www.highlanderracing.org/" style= "color: #fff">formula SAE</a>,an on campus organization
				that builds formula electric race cars. The experience that I have currently gained from this club has given me a
				large amount of exposure to microcontrollers. To date, I have taken two computer science
				courses at UCR, which both dive into the the interworkings of c++. I will be posting the majority of my coding projects on this
				page. Most of which will revolve around javascript, python, c++, and microcontrollers. Feel free to message me if you have
				any questions regarding any of my projects. Click on a project picture to be taken to the project.

					<div class="ProjectName"> <h2>Snake</h2> <p>3/15/20</p> </div>
					<a href="snake/index.html"><img id="snakeImg" src="../images/snake.png" align="left"></img></a>
					<p><br>This was my first object oriented javascript project. Using the framework p5.js, the program creates a canvas with a snake
						and food object. When the snake eats the food object, I call food.eat(), which teleports the food to a random
						location on the canvas. The snake object has a member variable, vector data structure. When the snake eats the food,
						I add 10 rectangles to that vector. Every frame, each rectangle positions itself in the location of the previous rectangle.
						I decided to have overlaping rectangle objects, so that I could create a smoothness the snake's animation. Click on the
						picture of the snake to be taken the project.

					<div> <h2 align="left">Fractals <small style="font-size: 17px">-a Visualization of Recursion</small></h2> <p>3/24/20</p> </div>
					<a href="Fractals/index.html"><img id="fractalImg" src="../images/fractals.png" align="left"></img></a>
					<p><br>This project takes a visual approach to recursion. As a student who just took an in depth look into recursion, it was quite intriguing to
						visualize that technique through a javascript project. The program utilizes the p5.js framework. The entire program revolves around the
						branch() function, which recusively calls itself in order to make the fractal images. The function takes in the parameter, length, which stroes the
						size of the branch. Length decreases after each implementation of the function. The banch() function also utilizes the saving
						and moving of the origin, since the program needs to dynamically draw lines at specific rotations and positions. The user is given the option
						to change the angle between branches, the branch length, the ratio at which each branch length decreases, and the length of the first initial branch. The sliders
						provided create an interface for the user to create their own unique fractal images. The "Trace" checkbox makes the program trace previous fractal images,
						and allows the user to combine many different images to create one dynamic sculpture.
